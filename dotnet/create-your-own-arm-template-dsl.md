# Create your own ARM template DSL

In the past I been asking abit on twitter and then at Azure Saturday 2017 here in copenhagen, i had the chance to talk abit with [Ryan Jones](https://twitter.com/rjmax) but ultimately the answer is no. The ARM parsing code is not avaible as opensource. In the same timeframe i also created some really naive code to do some of the stuff that ARM templates could do with variables and functions.

Knowing what i know today, i wish that i payed more attention in the compiler classes at uni - because what i really needed was the right search words on google about creating a DSL. So after finding the right resources, it took a few hours to get to the first prototype of my own DSL.

## building on top of JSON

Inspired by ARM (Azure Resource Manager) i also wanted to define my language build ontop of JSON. So having a declarative language where elements within the json document could be computed by use of functions and references to other parts of the document.
